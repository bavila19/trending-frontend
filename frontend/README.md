 #Trending 

 By Brenda G Avila Escamilla, Cindy Amaya and Emma Blaido. 
 
 Thank you for considering investing in our app! 

 #Trending is an app for people of all ages to keep up with todays generation. #Trending allows users to post and view a trend from 3 different categories which include "Dank Slang", a page where a user can find all of the newest and coolest words that are being used nowadays. A second category called "That's So fetch", that has all of the hip clothing trends that the younger generation can't get enough of. Lastly, "Book-Toc" a trend that took the planet by surpise because everyone is reading! Check out which books those are at #Trending. 

 We took inspiration from urban dictionary to create a full CRUD website that everyone can enjoy!

 We wanted our pages to have uniformity 
 and we kept the same layout across all pages.

 Home:
 Our Home page is the first thing a user sees. The Home page has a random word, fashion, and book trend. From there, the navigational bar displays the different links to which a user can explore.

 Dank Slang:
 At the top, a user has the option to post a new word by typing in the name, image, and description box. A user can also edit each post to make sure the website is keeping up with what's trendy and what isn't.
