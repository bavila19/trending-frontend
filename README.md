 Thank you for checking out #Trending! 

 #Trending is an app for people of all ages to keep up with todays generation. #Trending allows users to post and view a trend from 3 different categories which include "Dank Slang", a page where a user can find all of the newest and coolest words that are being used nowadays. A second category called "That's So fetch", that has all of the hip clothing trends that the younger generation can't get enough of. Lastly, "Book-Toc" a trend that took the planet by surpise because everyone is reading! Check out which books those are at #Trending. 

 We took inspiration from urban dictionary to create a full CRUD website that everyone can enjoy!

 Dank Slang:
 At the top, a user has the option to post a new word by typing in the name, image, and description box. A user can also edit each post to make sure the website is keeping up with what's trendy and what isn't.

 That's so Fetch:
 Once this page is opened, the user has the option to create a new fashion trend at the top. The user can also edit and check out the new styles that are in right now!

 Book-Toc:
 This page has all the books that are trending right now! The user can add a new book at the top of the page and edit any post. These books are on fire right now so get them while you can! It's like a big reading club!
